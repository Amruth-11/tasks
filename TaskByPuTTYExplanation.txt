Hello TechLead,

I have tried with the task that you have given on Tuesday i.e 01-10-2024.
The task is to automatically delete and create an existing container when
some changes are done in GitHub by using SSH configuration of PuTTY.

I have been trying to complete the task,but in putty after setting the
SSH configuration and after opening the terminal and tryiing to give my credentials 
after giving my username, it is showing like " server refused our key ".
I am working on it since yesterday and I have tried so many resources from the internet.
But,after trying them also i am getting the same as " server refused our key ".

So,I request you to please give me sometime to work on it.The task you have given
is as explained below.

EXPLANATION OF THE TASK :
-----------------------  

1. The applications we need for the task are
	i.Git
       ii.Jenkins
      iii.Docker
       iv.PuTTY
2. Make sure we have a particular repository in GitHub to do the task.
3. We need to install the required plugins(Git plugin, Docker Pipiline plugin, Pipeline plugin)
   from Jenkins.
4. PuTTY configuration :
   ===================
   -> Goto PuTTYgen to generate the SSH key pair.
   -> Now select the key type as 'RSA' and set the number of bits in the generated key to '4096'.
   -> Click on 'Generate',we will get a Private SSH key(.ppk) and Public SSH key.
   -> Save the private key and copy the public key.
   -> Now, we have to enter our servers hostname or IP address in Session category.
   -> On the left side we will find 'Connection', goto Connection,then goto SSh and then select Auth option.
      We will find a Browse option, in this we have to provide the private SSH key.
      -->Note :
         Sometimes we do not find the browse option in Auth, that time we have to press the '+' at Auth,we will
         find option as 'Credentials'.Click on that then we will find Browse option to give the private SSH key.
   -> Now save the session and click on open.
   -> PuTTY terminal will be opened and login to the server using user credentials.
   -> Now in PuTTY terminal,we need to install Jenkins and Docker by using follwing commands,

       > First we need to update the package index.
          - sudo apt update
            sudo apt upgrade -y

       > To install Jenkins,Java JDK needs to be installed mandatorily.
          - sudo apt install openjdk-21-jdk -y

       > Jenkins installation needs to follow some commands to install through PuTTY as follows,
          --> Adding the Jenkins key
               - wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add -
          --> Add the repository of Jenkins
               - echo deb http://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list
          --> Update the package again and install the Jenkins
               - sudo apt update
                 sudo apt install jenkins -y
          --> Start and enable Jenkins
               - sudo systemctl start jenkins
                 sudo systemctl enable jenkins
          --> For retrieving the initial admin password if necessary use the below command to get initial admin password.
               - sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword

5. ADDING SSH KEY TO GITHUB :
   ========================
  -> Goto GitHub account.
  -> Now go to the settings under profile section.
  -> We will see an option as SSH and GPG keys and select the option.
  -> Now click on New SSH key and paste the public SSH key in the key field.
  -> Give it a title and click on 'Add SSH key'.

6. JENKINS CONFIGURATION :
   =====================
   -> Goto Jenkins Dashboard,selct New item,name the job,select pipeline project and click on Ok.
   -> Now write the pipeline script as below,
    

      
    pipeline {
    agent any

    environment {
        DOCKER_CREDENTIALS_ID ='amruth11'
        DOCKER_IMAGE = 'amruth11/automationbyputty:latest'
        CONTAINER_NAME = 'MyAutomation' 
        BASE_PORT = 8112
    }

    stages {
        stage('Git Cloning') {
            steps {
                git credentialsId: 'Amruth-11', url: 'https://github.com/Amruth-11/automationbyputty.git'
            }
        }

       stage('Build Docker Image') {
            steps {
                script {
                    docker.build(DOCKER_IMAGE)
                }
            }
        }
        stage('Push Docker Image') {
            steps {
                script {
                    docker.withRegistry('https://index.docker.io/v1/', DOCKER_CREDENTIALS_ID) {
                        docker.image(DOCKER_IMAGE).push()
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Stop and remove the existing container if it exists
                    bat """
                        FOR /F "tokens=*" %%i IN ('docker ps -q -f "name=${CONTAINER_NAME}"') DO (
                            docker stop %%i  
                            docker rm -f %%i 
                        )
                    """

                    // Check if the base port is available
                    def port = BASE_PORT
                    while (true) {
                        def isPortUsed = bat(script: "netstat -ano | findstr :${port}", returnStatus: true) == 0
                        if (!isPortUsed) {
                            break
                        }
                        port++
                    }

                    // Run the new container on the available port
                    bat "docker run -d --name ${CONTAINER_NAME} -p ${port}:80 ${DOCKER_IMAGE}"
                    echo "New container deployed on port: ${port}"
                }
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        always {
            // Optionally clean up any dangling images
            script {
                bat "docker image prune -f"
            }
        }
    }
}

  ==> Now we can test the pipeline by using Build Now!

  ==> The complete configuration of SSH using PuTTY and setting up Jenkins with Docker to automate the deployment 
      pipeline, and to delete and recreate a Docker container when changes are detected in my Git repository.
